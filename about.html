            <p>
                Motivated by our joint love of traveling, we created a family determined to go everywhere and see everything. We've done a lot but in no way are we close to being done. We believe in packing light and pretty much only take home pictures as souvenirs. We have said yes to the occasional local market trinket.

                Kian brings fresh eyes to our travels at the T List Adventure Company. Kian joined in June of 2015 and since then, he's been non-stop planning for the next plane ride. He believes that the journey is more important than the destination. It is his goal to travel by space shuttle one day.
